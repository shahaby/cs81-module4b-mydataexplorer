## Were your predictions right?

- My prediction about the most screen time being on Wednesday was right.
- My prediction about more caffeine equaring to better better focus proved to be wrong.

## What surprised you?

- I was surprised by how hard it is to track daily habits.

## What was tricky or rewarding?

- It was tricky to analyze the correlation between caffeine and focus, as the data was not straightforward. However, it was rewarding to see clear patterns in my mood and focus levels.

## How did using your own data change things?

- Using my own data made it harder to work on this project. I much rather work with very large sets of data collected by others.
